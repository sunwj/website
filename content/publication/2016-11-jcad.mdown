abstract = "Volume rendering based on standard CUDA ray casting always under-utilize the computational power of current GPU hardware. One of the reasons for this observation is that the SIMT execution model may cause warp divergence due to irregular execution behavior. This paper avoided this weakness by adopting the warp-marching method. Instead of mapping each ray into one thread, we integrate one ray using all of the threads in a warp which will execute instructions in lock-step, hence, no divergence will occur. Besides, we also incorporated dynamic work scheduling strategy into warp-marching to further improve performance of warp-marching by better balancing computation coresâ€™ workloads. Results of experiments indicate that our method can achieve speedup range from 1.9 to 7.9 when compared with standard CUDA implementation."
